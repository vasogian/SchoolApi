# SchoolApi
I have developed an API which manages and updates information about students, teachers and subjects of a school. It is connected to a database, where all information
is saved and the API consists of 16 endpoints, which include all CRUD actions. I have structured the project based on the MVC pattern and have used dependency injection
to all controllers, in order to avoid newing up new objects and make the project more maintainable. I have used the following technology and programming concepts:
 1. MVC 
 2. Dependency Injection 
 3. Repository Pattern
 4. AutoMapper 
 5. Entity Framework Core
